Hangouts Against Humanity - ArsTechnica version
===============================================

"Cards Against Humanity"-like game for Google Plus Hangouts, ArsTechnica version. "Ars Against Humanity", if you will. This isn't an Ars-sponsored (or approved!) project; it was born out of the awesome Ars Hangouts Against Humanity Friday night sessions.

Forked from samurailink3's great work.

The eventual goal of this project is to create a javascript framework for this type of card game. The engine will be completely expandable by using a simple JSON file of new cards.

Thanks to Cards Against Humanity for this great CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0 game!
